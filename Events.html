		<p style="font-size: 23px;"> This is the go kart event where a lot of people created their own cars and then raced against others. There were different rewards, one for the first car to reach the finish line, and one for the best looking car. We made our go-kart for speed, hoping that we would win the race but we came third. This was a very fun event and it is being held every year, we would love for more people to come as it means that there will be more competition. This is the only main event we have been to outside of school and it was very fun because you got to see all the other go-karts people made and some were very funny as you can see in the pictures.</p>
