		<h4 style="text-align:center;">Go-Kart</h4>
		<img src="./Go Kart.jpg" class="center">
		<p style="font-size: 23px;">This is the go-kart that we made for the go-kart event. It took us around 2 months to create the go-kart that looks like a bicycle. The other go-kart was made last year but we upgraded it by making it look better and increasing its speed. The maximum speed the go-kart could go was 30 kilometers per hour. Safety is very important so we added a seatbelt as well and wore a helmet when riding. Making the go-kart was very fun and everyone in the club learned a lot of things from this project and even thought it took up a lot of our time, it was well worth it. </p>

		<h4 style="text-align:center;">Bathroom Passes</h4>
		<img src="./Bathroom Passes.PNG" class="center">
		<p style="font-size: 23px;">These are some of the bathroom passes that we made for our teachers at Seoul Foreign School. We made it so that whenever a student had to go to the bathroom, they would take one of these passes with them so that other teacher knew that they were excused. We gave them out for free but some of the teachers paid us for the passes which was really helpful for the club as we could make more things with the money. We made the bathroom passes with the laser cutter from the design lab in our school by using colored acrylic after we drew them on adobe and made the design there.</p>

		<h4 style="text-align:center;">Keychains and Stickers</h4>
		<img src="./Key Chains.PNG" class="center">
		<p style="font-size: 23px;">These are some of the keychains we made for a club fair that we had in school. We sold these keychains for 500 won each and three for 1000 won. We also made the keychains using a laser cutter that we have in the design lab and just like the bathroom passes, we made them using colored acrylic and designing them on adobe. We also made stickers that have one of our club logos on them so that people knew about our club. We also sold the stickers but these for 100 won each as we made many of them and it didn't cost us too much money, so we would make a lot of profit to create more things for the club. </p>

		<h4 style="text-align:center;">Other Products</h4>
		<img src="./Wood.PNG" class="center">
		<p style="font-size: 23px;">These are some of the other products we made, not only for the club but also for members of the club to keep. For example, Jonathan Ben Shoshan made the Juice World wood design for a tik tok he made. This shows people that we are very flexible because we allow club members to do pretty much anything they want if they have a good plan. As you can see, we also made nike logos which you can put anywhere you want like on your clothes or stick it on your computer.</p>
