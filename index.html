    <p1><strong> Go-Kart </strong></p1>
    <p> - This is the go-kart that we made for the event shown in the right </p>
    <p> - It took us around 2 months to create the go-kart that looks like a bicycle </p>
    <p> - The other go-kart was made last year but we upgraded it by making it look better and increasing its speed </p>
    <p> - The maximum speed the go-kart could go was 30 kilometers per hour </p>
    <p> - Safety is very important so we added a seatbelt as well and wore a helmet when riding </p>

    <p1><strong> Go-Kart Event </strong></p1>
    <p> - This is the go kart event where a lot of people created their own cars and then raced against others </p>
    <p> - There were different rewards, one for the first car to reach the finish line, and one for the best looking car </p>
    <p> - We made our go-kart for speed hoping that we would win the race but we came third </p>
    <p> - This was a very fun event and it is being held every year, we would love for more people to come</p>
